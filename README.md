# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

Welcome to **CardioSense** – a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a person using logistic regression. This model is built with simplicity and precision to help explore how data-driven decisions can save lives.

## 🔍 Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can save lives.  
This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on medical data to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease or not.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Logistic Regression**  
  A simple yet powerful classification algorithm used for binary outcomes — in this case, **disease or no disease**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient information like:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression (Oldpeak)
- and more...

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed for better performance  
✅ Features scaled and encoded where necessary

---

## 📈 Accuracy 

- **Model Accuracy**: ~85–90% (varies depending on data split & tuning)

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for ML model & evaluation)
